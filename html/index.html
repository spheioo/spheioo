              The annual Poly50 Campus Relay, organized by the Department of Student Development,
              began in the 1970s at the Prince Edward Road Campus. Back then,
            
              <span class="read-more-content hidden">               
                 students would run along the classroom corridors and on muddy tracks around the campus.
                When the campus moved to Ayer Rajah, the relay took place around the workshops.<br><br>
                Upon relocating to the Dover Campus in 1980, participants ran 50 laps along a 
                600-meter route bordered by workshops and the main administration building.<br><br>
                Only once in 1984 was the event shortened to 30 laps, to mark SP's 30th Anniversary.<br><br>
                In 2012, the route was changed to encompass the Eleven Square area. Since then, the relay routes
                have been periodically updated to reflect the ongoing changes at SP.<br><br>
                The objectives of Poly50 are to foster social cohesion and interaction among SP students, staff,
                and alumni, while promoting fitness and the importance of regular exercise for a healthy
                lifestyle.
